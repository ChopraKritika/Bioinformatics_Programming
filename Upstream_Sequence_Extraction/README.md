## Usage

This code extracts 1.5kb upstream sequence for the given number of genes from the whole genome FASTA file 

Important Points:

1. You should have a FASTA file containing sequences for all chromosomes
2. You should have a BED file containing chromosome name/number, start site, end site and gene names. Also, your BED file must contain headers
3. The output file will contain gene name, chromosome name/number, upstream start site, upstream end site as identifiers along with upstream sequences in the FASTA file.
